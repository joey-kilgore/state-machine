This is the repo to accompany my problem solving video series. Check it out over on my YouTube channel [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpOsORCF5BYM72H0c2Nzc1Q)

# General Overview  
In this project we will create a state machine that will allow us to give inputs and go from one state to another. The end goal will do the following

- Read in a file containing the states and the transitions
- Have the user enter what state they would like to start in
- Have the user enter a transition and output the new state they are in
- Repeat the previous step until the user enters "EXIT"

With this we will have to focus on utilizing data structures to improve our ability to solve a problem, and noting that there are multiple ways to store data that still solve this problem.

See the [assignment pdf](https://github.com/joey-kilgore/state-machine/blob/main/assignment.pdf) for the entire breakdown and sample images and file formats.  
Additional sample data is given in the [sample-data folder](https://github.com/joey-kilgore/state-machine/tree/main/sample-data).
